# Hybrid Managed Backup
### Scalable Customized Backup Solution Using NAS &amp; AWS Backbone
> Designed and implemented a hybrid cloud backup solution combining
            on-premise NAS with AWS cloud infrastructure for scalability and
            redundancy. Leveraged AWS EC2, S3, and microservices architecture to
            build a resilient, automated system tailored to client-specific data
            protection needs. Developed custom API endpoints to support flexible
            scheduling, retention policies, and encryption, ensuring secure and
            efficient backups across distributed environments.
